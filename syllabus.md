# Syllabus: Fundamentals of Software Architecture

## Meeting 2

### Required Material:

- Chapter 1 - 2

### Supplementary Material:

- "Industry tips for transitioning into software architecture", [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV8HNsFWHD4)
- "Lesson 93 - What is Software Architecture", [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6rfJjd8714&feature=emb_logo)
- "Who needs an architect?", [essay](https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf)

### Pre-meeting preparatory questions:
#### Chapter 1
- [ ] On your current or recent past project name the architecture
  - structure
  - a characteristic
  - a decision
  - a design principle
- [ ] Of the eight expectations of an architect which, in your view, is the most interesting? The most challenging? Why?
- [ ] How is one of the intersecting disciplines (engineering practices, devops, process, or data) impacting architecture on your current or recent past project?

#### Chapter 2
- [ ] Does Rangle follow the traditional approach of architecture versus development on projects? Why or why not?
- [ ] What are some ideas for efficiently, and continuously growing technical breadth?
- [ ] How “hands-on” in the codebase is the solution architect and/or technical director on your current or recent past project? What impact does it have?

#### Chapter 3
- [ ] Do you have good supplementary resources for the metrics in chapter 3? Please share!

## Meeting 3

### Required Material:

- Chapter 3

### Supplementary Material:
- "Lesson 11 - Analyzing Architecture: Code Metrics", [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pELKNy8B5Nw)
- "Revisiting LCOM", [article](http://www.designsmells.com/articles/revisiting-lcom/)
- Excerpts from "Clean Architecture" to come

### Pre-meeting preparatory questions:
- [ ] How would you define a module in your own words? What is the difference between a module and a component?
- [ ] What is the “modular unit” of Javascript?
- [ ] How would you define cohesion? 
- [ ] Can you find an example of one of the types of cohesion (functional, sequential, communicational, procedural, temporal, logical, coincidental) in your current or recent past codebase? 
- [ ] What does the LCOM measure? Can it be used for JS codebases, if so how?
- [ ] How would you define coupling, a.k.a how do we know when things are coupled?
- [ ] How would you define abstract in the context of the Abstractness metric?
- [ ] What can be considered an abstraction in Javascript?
- [ ] How would you define “stable” and “unstable” in the context of the Instability metric?
- [ ] Is stability a good thing and is instability a bad thing in all contexts? When should a module be stable or unstable?
- [ ] In the main sequence graph, why is the highly concrete and stable region called the “Zone of Pain”? Why is the highly abstract and unstable region called the “Zone of Uselessness”?
- [ ] Outside of the "Zones of Exclusion", where do we ideally want modules to be on the graph?
- [ ] How should we use the distance from the main sequence metric be used?
- [ ] What is the difference between connascence and coupling?
- [ ] What is an example of a type of connascence in your current or recent past codebase?
