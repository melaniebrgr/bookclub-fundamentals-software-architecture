# Chapter 4 & 5, "Part3":

## Description
> The overall domain problem the system is trying to solve

Phase 1 of a project is design, estimates, quote
THere's learning along the way, all these things need to be documented and traced in a particular way
Collaborative env: many different people coming together
Change blaming dynamic
Bring everyone together

## Users
> The expected number and/or types of users of the system
Consultant teams can vary widely, 20+ typically, smaller 10-5
As a company there is a lot of variability 10 - 100
Competitors have a cost per seat
Differentiate by not having a limit
Primary client is architecture firm
Part of growth strategy is network effect, client is arch firm, they invite other companies
Adoption is unpredictable
No one is working on the weekend

## Requirements
> Domain/domain-level requirements, as an architect might expect from domain users/domain experts

When a project ends need to archive it so it can be resurface years later for legal reasons
May need to resurface project years later
Don't want these 10-100s GB documents into cheaper storage
They have regulatory requirements in terms of documentation, there's different contract types they adhere to, and certain elements need to be listed
Ensuring proper hand off
There needs to be an audit log, so everything is traceable, need from business perspective

## Additional context
> Many of the considerations an architect must make arenâ€™t explicitly expressed in requirements but rather by implicit knowledge of the problem domain

Resistant to change, which so much attention has gone into the the ui.
Needs to be clear
Use may be onsite where there is no or low connectivity and needs to work offlines
Expecte users to use modern tools no IE11
Most don't use Mac, they user MS surfaces
