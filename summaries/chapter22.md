## Team Boundaries
An architect creates “just right” constraints for the development team to work in. What is “just right”? Somewhere between the control freak and am chair architect styles. The control freak is more a risk of junior architects. They impose restrictions that end up limiting the solutioning potential of the team. The arm chair architect is more a risk of senior developers who have lost touch with software development and don’t understand the domain well.

### Team constraints
Team constraints depend on the level of control needed for the particular team, i.e. the architect needs to be “elastic” in their decision of how much and how little. There are team and project related factors that the help determine control level: team familiarity, team size, team experience, project complexity, project duration. These can be used to sort of quantify the level of control exerted by the architect, e.g.:
- Do not know each other +20
- Small team -20
- Experienced -20
- Simple project +20
- Short time-frame -20
- Score = -60 arm chair of less control
For consultancy we feel there is an additional factor to consider, organizational complexity, (there might be a better word for it) that captures when the context of the client organization dictates that an architect needs to provide stricter or looser constraints. For example, there is a lot of uncertainty from the client about what they want, or their way of worked poses so risks to the mission of the project, the archictect may need to step in with more team guidance.

We also discusses that short-time frames, with complex projects, can equally mean there should be more constraints in place so the team "does not go off the rails" within the more compressed timeline.

### Team size
The larger a team the more productivity is lost due to “process loss” (mythical man month). Examples of process loss are merge conflicts, and duplication of effort; “pluralistic ignorance” where people people are more fearful of speaking up the larger the group and appearing ignorant, but in actual fact it was an important contribution; and “diffusion of responsibility” where the large the group the more likely we are to think it is someone else’s responsibility.

### Checklists
The author’s like them for code completion, unit and functional testing and software release—presumably the parts that cannot be automated. Many things can act as a checklist of sorts, e.g. in JIRA we can create subtasks on a story that act as a to do list. ACs are a checklist of sorts.

### Providing guidance
By asking questions. An approach to MRs in general.
