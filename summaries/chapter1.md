# Chapter 1 & 2

There isn't a one size fits all architecture style, or characterists, or decisions for different projects. For example, the architectural style your passionate about may not fir your problem.

"Structure without implementation or content" creating an environment where business logic can thrive.

Some of the examples given are fairly canonical, e.g. layered with a presentational and business layers. Understanding of structure can depend on the industry, e.g. "layered" is more common in banking industry, while in retail others are more common. One characteristics of software architecture is incorporating business knowledge on decisions such as structure. Client concerns is certainly another consideration.

Context is important. For example, if the design system is the product we can consider smart and dumb components as an architectural decision. If the decision to pass props is impacting agility, it asks the question of whether its architecture.

As a software architect want to avoid "micromanaging" the developers especially if the developers are experienced.

Noe of the expectaions are necessarily surprising but how much of each is necessary to fulfill the role.
How do you train for understanding and navigating politics (is it just convincing people of things)?
- Just through experience working clients
- Consider everyone a stakeholder, its never convincing one person its a system
- Are there key stakeholders to prioritize?

How do we keep current? Getting diverse exposer and experience is expected but would take a lot of intentional effort to get there?
- Work on different projects

- How to architect it, [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOtCpD23118&list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb)
- Spend an hour a day? 20 min a day? Bursts of high intensity learning. It depends. How surprising.

How do you define breadth. If you can justify pros and cons for using one soluation over another, that is enough to have breadth. If you can implement that's depth.
