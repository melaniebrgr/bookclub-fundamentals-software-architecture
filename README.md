## ["Fundamentals of Software Architecture"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/), by Mark Richards & Neal Ford

> "There are not right or wrong answers in architecture - only trade-offs."

### Meeting agenda:

We'll meet every 3 weeks for 0.5-1hr to discuss the chapters. A meeting typically consists of an 5-10 min review of the chapters using the self-assessment questions at the end of the book, followed by a [lean coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) style discussion or working on an [architectural kata](http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas/) together. Occasionally guests will be invited for a special discussion, e.g. a panel on microservices, and these meetings will be open to all Ranglers. A few minutes will also be reserved at the end to a give the opportunity to provide feedback so we can continuously improve the format of the meetings.

As you read, if there's something you'd like to discuss in greater depth, you can make a note of it in the [discussions](https://github.com/melaniebrgr/bookclub-fundamentals-software-architecture/discussions), or if there's an important take-away you want to capture, you can add it to the shared [chapter summaries](https://github.com/melaniebrgr/bookclub-fundamentals-software-architecture/tree/main/summaries) document. Also, while it's better to read the chapter ahead of time, it's not mandatory and if you don't have time (it happens) you should try to come to book club anyway. The richest discussions are ones where people from all levels of experience and understanding contribute. Really! ðŸ™‚ Finally, since this book is a long one we'll read it in three parts with breaks in between and give a chance for members to drop and join.
