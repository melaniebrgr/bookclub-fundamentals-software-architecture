## ["Fundamentals of Software Architecture"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/), by Mark Richards & Neal Ford

> "There are no right or wrong answers in architecture - only trade-offs."

### Meeting agenda:

We'll meet every two weeks for 30 min to talk about the chapters. Each meeting will consist of an 5-10 min review of the chapters using the self-assessment questions as prompts, and then a [lean coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) style discussion, and/or working on an [architectural kata](http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas/) together. As you read, if you think of something you want to talk about, make a note of it in the [Discussions](https://github.com/melaniebrgr/bookclub-fundamentals-software-architecture/discussions). Also, while it's better to read the chapter ahead of time, it's not mandatory and if you don't have time (it happens) you should try to come to book club anyway. The richest discussions are ones where people from all levels of experience and understanding contribute. Really! ðŸ™‚ Finally, since this book is a long one, we'll read it in three parts with breaks in between and give a chance for members to drop and join.
